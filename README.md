# rrdtool-monitoring
Collection of scripts to monitor Operating System, Apache, Varnish, and MySQL metrics.

Modified from scripts taken from: https://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/15964.html

New metrics were added as well as support for Apache, Varnish, and MySQL.  The metrics are very basic for now and need more work.  I have also not created an installer for my version as of yet.

Use at your own risk!
